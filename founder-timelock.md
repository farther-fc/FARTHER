# Founder Timelock

The founder allocation (50m $farther) is currently in two Sablier streams:

1. https://app.sablier.com/stream/LL3-8453-131/
2. https://app.sablier.com/stream/LL3-8453-132/

The reason it is split between two is a mistake was made when selecting the dates. The first stream was set to linearly stream from Jan 1 2024 to Jan 1 2026 (should have been Jan 2025-27). So the portion that was immediately unlocked was withdrawn and put into the second stream which won't begin until Jan 1 2026 and last until August of that year.

The first stream can be easily locked in a time lock contract to provide assurances to the community that the vesting tokens won't enter circulation until a specific date.
